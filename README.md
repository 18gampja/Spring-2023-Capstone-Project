**Swarm Intelligence Project TODO:**
- ~~Send commands to M5 from turtlebot/PC~~ DONE
- ~~Ability to send more than one command to M5~~ DONE
- More functionality built into M5
  - Currently only have "moveForward" as a proof of concept. More complex tasks are planned.
- ~~DO THE COMMENTS FOR COMMUNICATION STUFF~~ DONE, but could probably use more comments
- Format status string received from M5


**Quick Info**
- The "acceptTurtleCommand.py" file is deprecated. Please use "talkToPi.py."
